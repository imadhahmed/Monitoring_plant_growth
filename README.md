# üå± Plant Growth Monitoring System  

An automated image processing system that monitors and analyzes plant growth in controlled environments using Python and OpenCV.


## üìå Project Overview  
This system provides automated plant monitoring through:  
- Time-lapse image capture of plants  
- Growth pattern analysis and leaf counting  
- Plant health assessment  
- Visual growth report generation  

Eliminates manual monitoring limitations with computer vision techniques.

## ‚ú® Key Features  

### Image Processing  
- Noise reduction & contrast adjustment  
- Image enhancement for better analysis  

### Plant Analysis  
- Leaf segmentation (thresholding/edge detection)  
- Growth pattern quantification  
- Health indicator assessment  

### Visualization  
- Growth trend graphs  
- Comparative analysis reports
